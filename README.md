# NOTICE

This repository contains part of the v3.x Moodle extension of Kaltura which is *not* based on KAF and is *not* the latest version.

The current Kaltura Moodle extension is at version 4.x and is based on KAF, and it is being maintained in a different repository - https://github.com/kaltura/moodle_plugin/

If you are using Kaltura CE, the v3.x is the version that you can use (KAF is a licensed product), but note that v3.x extension is no longer maintained by Kaltura.

If you are a customer using the v4.x KAF-based version and have an issue to report or a fix to suggest, please use the relevant [repository](https://github.com/kaltura/moodle_plugin/) for pull requests and issues (although issues can also be reported via customer care).
